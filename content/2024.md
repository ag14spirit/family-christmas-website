What a year 2024 has been! As always, we're thankful for all the blessings, growth, and even the chaos that came with raising Ellie (4 in March) and Emmie (2 in March). We've had our share of celebrations, family adventures, and everyday moments that remind us how much God's love is woven into the highs and lows of life.

We kicked off January with friend time, Chick-fil-A dates, and park days despite the chilly weather. Emmie was right there, always curious, keeping up with her sister. In February, family visited to celebrate Emmie's baby dedication at our church.

March was all about celebrating—Emmie turned one, Ellie turned three, Jen turned 32, and we even squeezed in our 8th anniversary! Ellie was convinced her birthday lasted a month long because we had a party celebrated both girls at the beginning of the month, celebrated her in her class, then celebrated her birthDAY, and lastly rode donkeys in early April! The girls got a playhouse for their birthday (thanks Josh and Pop for the assembly) and have loved playing in it!

In April, we visited Aggieland Safari—an Eland tried to take Emmie's banana! We were cracking up the whole time!

Over summer we had swim lessons, dance class, zoo trips, Blue Bell, and smoked lots of meat. We celebrated cousin Cal's 1st birthday! On 4th of July Jen, the girls and Lolli visited the neighbors as a little parade—we'll keep you posted if this becomes a tradition!

We spent a lot of time in the water trying to keep cool. We also tried a bouldering gym as a fun way to beat the heat! Ellie loved it! Emmie ran around but wasn't quite big enough to climb. We got our back deck replaced with pavement and have spent many hours in the back!

Jen also got to volunteer as a nurse at <a href="https://belovedandbeyond.org">Beloved and Beyond</a> and wants to make that an annual thing!

We visited Austin family and made ice cream with cousins, and our girls loved it so much we ended up getting Josh an ice cream maker for his birthday. Emmie joined Ellie at Kingdom Kids preschool in August. Josh finished managing his first massive construction project just in time for his birthday.

Fall brought all the traditions: pumpkin patches, campfire nights, and the ever teasing cooler weather. Jen started working out with some friends at <a href="https://madewellhouse.com">Made Well House</a> and is so thankful for that community! Jen also got to go to some Broadway in Austin plays with her mom! Sickness hit our friend group hard so Halloween ended up being a little more low-key than we planned. We dressed up as Paw Patrol and visited some neighbors in our <i>cul de sac</i>.

November started a little rough with sickness, but we ended up making sweet memories at Great Wolf Lodge! We had great plans for Thanksgiving to visit both sides of our family but ended up being flexible and creative because illness struck again. Ellie and Jen visited family in Austin. Emmie and Josh joined them later that week to celebrate Thanksgiving with family in San Antonio!

December is here, and we celebrated Lolli's birthday by going to Santa's Wonderland with the McKenna Family!

Through it all, we're reminded of how God's grace meets us in every season—in the big milestones and the quiet moments alike. We're so grateful for each of you, and we pray this Christmas brings peace, joy, and reminders of God's love for you too.

**Wishing you all a wonderful Christmas and an exciting 2024!**
