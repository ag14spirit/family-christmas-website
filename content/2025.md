What a year 2025 has been! If last year was full of blessings and chaos, this year was full of *adventure* and *big change*. We kicked off January in Texas, celebrating date nights (A Complete Unknown!), daddy spa nights, and snow at our beloved Faimes home. We had no idea that by May, we'd be saying goodbye to everything we'd ever known in Texas and hello to a completely new chapter in Birmingham, Alabama.

In March, Josh received a job offer from MediaMerge, a large audiovisual systems integrator serving churches, museums, and municipal clients across the country. After much prayer and many family discussions, we decided to say yes to this opportunity for Josh's career growth. We spent our final weeks in Texas squeezing in as much time as possible with our Grace Church family, home group, and Texas loved ones. We celebrated Emmie's Minnie Mouse birthday, Ellie's birthday with friends, anniversaries, and even got to celebrate Pop being 14 years cancer free! In late April, we packed up our lives, said tearful goodbyes at a farewell gathering, and in May—right after Mother's Day—we drove to Alabama in a moving truck.

The move itself was bittersweet. We stopped in Baton Rouge for beignets and oysters (a little Southern welcome!), and arrived in Birmingham at the end of May to start our new adventure. We're so grateful for the community the Lord gave us in Texas and the connections He's already making here in Alabama.

June and July were all about exploring our new city and finding our rhythm. Jen obtained her Alabama nursing license, and we discovered some wonderful spots: the Birmingham Zoo, McWane Science Center, Aldridge Gardens, and the beautiful hiking trails at Red Mountain Park and Moss Rock Preserve. The girls have taken this big transition remarkably well—Ellie occasionally mentions missing her Texas friends, but overall they're thriving with new adventures almost every week.

In August, Ellie and Emmie started at Shades Crest Preschool, where they've found wonderful teachers and friends. Josh celebrated his birthday, and we welcomed some new friends into our lives—Allyssa and Jacob quickly became family favorites, and we've been grateful to find a church home at Valleydale Church where we're meeting other families and building community.

The Lord has been faithful in the smallest and biggest ways. In September, we got a new van (made possible by a partial early inheritance from Josh's grandfather—what a blessing!). Josh has stepped into an increasingly leadership-oriented role at MediaMerge, though it means he's often stretched thin and traveling for work. Jen has been absolutely incredible managing the girls' activities, unpacking our home, meal planning, and keeping our family grounded during this transition.

And then, in October, we got the biggest surprise of all—*we're expecting twins in April 2026!* Josh's dad is generously helping us purchase a home in Birmingham to make space for our growing family, and we're in the process of building and preparing for this new season.

November brought celebrations: Lolli and Pop visited, we welcomed a new cousin (Baby Madison!), and we've been reflecting on how God's faithfulness shows up in community, in answered prayers, and in unexpected blessings.

As we head into 2026, we're holding tightly to the truth that God's grace meets us in every season—in big moves, new jobs, new friends, growing families, and all the uncertainty that comes with it. We're so grateful for each of you, for your prayers during this transition, and for the ways you've stayed connected with us across the miles.

**Wishing you all a wonderful Christmas filled with peace, joy, and the comfort of God's love.**
