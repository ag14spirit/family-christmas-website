What a year 2025 has been! If last year was full of blessings and chaos, this year was full of *adventure*, *big change*, and the humbling reality of building community from scratch. We kicked off January in Texas, celebrating date nights (A Complete Unknown!), daddy spa nights, and snow at our beloved Faimes home. We had no idea that by May, we'd be saying goodbye to everything we'd ever known in Texas and hello to a completely new chapter in Birmingham, Alabama.

In March, Josh received a job offer from MediaMerge, a large audiovisual systems integrator serving churches, museums, and municipal clients across the country. After much prayer and many family discussions, we decided to say yes to this opportunity for Josh's career growth. We spent our final weeks in Texas squeezing in as much time as possible with our Grace Bible Church family, home group, and Texas loved ones. We celebrated Emmie's Minnie Mouse birthday, Ellie's birthday with friends, anniversaries, and even got to celebrate Pop being 14 years cancer free! In late April, we packed up our lives, said tearful goodbyes at a farewell gathering, and in May—right after Mother's Day—we drove to Alabama in a moving truck.

The move itself was bittersweet. We stopped in Baton Rouge for beignets and oysters (a little Southern welcome!), and arrived in Birmingham at the end of May to start our new adventure. We're so grateful for the community the Lord gave us in Texas—especially our decade-long Grace Bible Church family that became our spiritual home—and we're learning that building community doesn't happen overnight.

**Finding Our People**

One of the hardest parts of this move has been finding a church home. We spent a decade at Grace Bible Church, first as congregants and later with Josh on staff. It wasn't just a Sunday gathering—it was our people, our spiritual family, our place of belonging. Starting over has been humbling.

In June, we visited Green Valley Church after a chance encounter with a former coworker of Josh's from Grace Bible Church who recommended it. It felt like a little gift from the Lord—proof that He was walking with us even in our loneliness. We found welcoming people and solid teaching, and it was a good first step.

Then in July, as Jen was attending a women's Bible study, she reconnected with an old acquaintance from college who invited her to Valleydale Church. What started as a reconnection became a real friendship and a new church home. We threw ourselves into Valleydale's community, joined a re|engage marriage class, and met some phenomenal mentor couples—people with deep wisdom and life experience who have poured into us and walked alongside us during this vulnerable season of transition. Those relationships became anchors for our family.

But here's where God's faithfulness gets beautifully complicated: as the fall progressed, we felt the Lord calling us toward the Church at Brook Hills, primarily so our girls could build stronger connections with some of our dearest friends and their children. These are people we love deeply, and our girls adore playing with their kids. It felt important to prioritize that community for our family right now.

It's been disorienting to move churches again after such a short time, and honestly, it doesn't make perfect logical sense. But we're learning that sometimes following Jesus means being willing to be uncomfortable, to keep saying yes to community even when it's messy, and to trust that the Lord knows what our family needs—even when we don't.

June and July were about exploring our new city beyond church walls. Jen started the hard work on obtaining her Alabama nursing license, and we discovered some wonderful spots: the Birmingham Zoo, McWane Science Center, Aldridge Gardens, and the beautiful hiking trails at Red Mountain Park and Moss Rock Preserve. The girls have taken this big transition remarkably well—Ellie occasionally mentions missing her Texas friends, but overall they're thriving with new adventures almost every week.

In August, Ellie and Emmie started at Shades Crest Preschool, where they've found wonderful teachers and friends. Josh celebrated his birthday, and we celebrated with our new friends, Allyssa and Jacob, who quickly became family favorites over the summer, and their friendship has been such a gift in this season of transition.

The Lord has been faithful in the smallest and biggest ways. In September, we got a new van (made possible by a partial early inheritance from Josh's grandfather—what a blessing!). Josh has stepped into an increasingly leadership-oriented role at MediaMerge, though it means he's often stretched thin and traveling for work. Jen has been absolutely incredible managing the girls' activities, unpacking our home, meal planning, and keeping our family grounded during this transition.

**New Blessings**

And then, in October, we got the biggest surprise of all—*we're expecting twins in April 2026!* Josh's dad is generously helping us purchase a home in Birmingham to make space for our growing family, and we're in the process of building and preparing for this new season.

November brought celebrations: Lolli and Pop visited, we welcomed a new cousin (Baby Madison!), and we've been reflecting on how God's faithfulness shows up in community, in answered prayers, and in unexpected blessings.

As we head into 2026, we're holding tightly to the truth that God's grace meets us in every season—in big moves, new jobs, new friends, putting down roots in unfamiliar soil, and all the uncertainty that comes with growing families and changing landscapes. We're learning that community building is less about finding the perfect church and more about saying yes to Jesus and the people He puts in our path, even when it's uncomfortable and messy and requires us to be vulnerable again and again.

We're so grateful for each of you, for your prayers during this transition, for the friendships we're building here in Birmingham, and for the ways you've stayed connected with us across the miles.

**Wishing you all a wonderful Christmas filled with peace, joy, and the comfort of God's love.**

**Josh, Jen, Ellie, Emmie, and Baby Maggie Pup**
